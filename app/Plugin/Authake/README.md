Downlad
--------------

https://github.com/mtkocak/authake

For install instructions and feedback, please go to Authake home page: http://www.mtkocak.net/?p=333

Install
----------

1. Unzip the plugin to your app/Plugin folder with the name Authake. Case is important, lowercase folder name does not work.

2. You have to have in your bootstrap.php

        CakePlugin::loadAll();
        //or
        CakePlugin::load('Authake');

3. You can create schema from plugin using command to console terminal when you are in your app folder: 

        Console/cake schema create -plugin Authake

    Or Alternatively you can add the Authake/db/authake_clean.sql to your database.

4. Add this to your config/database.php to make authake work.

    The idea behind this is that it would be possible to have 1 Authake instalation which handle multiple apps.

        var $authake = array(
        'datasource' => 'Database/Mysql',
        'persistent' => false,
        'host' => 'localhost',
        'login' => ", //username for the db
        'password' => ", //password for the db
        'database' => 'authake', //or any other where you have imported the authake.sql file
        'prefix' => ",
        );

5. Create AppController.php in you'r app's Controller folder first.

    Change it's contents like this: UPDATED: No need debug_kit anymore

    <?php

        class AppController extends Controller {
        	var $helpers = array('Form', 'Time', 'Html', 'Session', 'Js', 'Authake.Authake');
        	var $components = array('Session','RequestHandler', 'Authake.Authake');
        	var $counter = 0;
        	function beforeFilter(){
        		$this->auth();
        	}
        	private function auth(){
        		Configure::write('Authake.useDefaultLayout', true);
        		$this->Authake->beforeFilter($this);
        	}

        }
        ?>

6. Use username: **admin** password: **admin** to login
